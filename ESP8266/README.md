#Portable installation
This folder contains my ESP8266 sketchbook for the Arduino IDE.
Make a Portable folder under your Arduino IDE .exe folder.
When restarted new sketches will be placed in \Portable\sketchbook\ and installed libraries will be placed in \Portable\sketchbook\libraries.

#Current versions
Currently I use the Arduino 1.6.10 IDE with the Adafruit GFX library version 1.2.2. 
The board manager says I'm using the "esp8266 by ESP8266 Community" version 2.3.0
